<h3>Global variable redeclaration in notebook</h3>
<p>
  This inspection detects cases where a global variable is re-declared within the same Jupyter notebook.
  Redefining global variables can lead to unexpected results or bugs, especially when executing cells in an arbitrary order.
</p>
<p>
  Redefinitions of common loop variables (e.g., <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code>, etc.) are ignored to reduce noise.
  However, redefinition of larger objects like lists, DataFrames, or dictionaries is flagged as a potential issue.
</p>
<p>
  If the redefinition is intentional, you can use the provided "Suppress for this statement" quick-fix to silence the warning for that specific occurrence.
</p>
<p>
  Note: This inspection applies only to Jupyter notebook files (<code>.ipynb</code>).
